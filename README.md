# TEST
This is a simple test repository for learning GitHub. This ReadMe also contains some useful information for using GitHub with Eclipse.

IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY:

Repository - this is essentially a folder where all of the code, as well as all changes to the code are stored.

Remote repository - This is the central repository on the GitHub cloud.

Local repository - a local copy of the remote repository, generally stored on an individual person's computer.

Commit - a log of all of the changes that have been made to the code since the last commit. It also includes the author of the changes, and the time the commit was made. Making a commit is the git equivalent of saving your work.

Push - pushing uploads a commit stored on your personal workspace to the central repository (in this case a repository on GitHub). This means that all of the changes you've made to a branch apply to everyone else using the remote repository.

Branches - branches are different versions of the code stored in a repository. GitHub always has a 'main' branch, which represents the most up-to-date 'production' ready version of the code. By default, this branch is called 'master'. For more information about branches, see the GitHub workflow.

Clone - cloning a Git repository creates a local copy of it on your computer.

Fetch - fetching gathers all of the changes made in the remote repository, and stores them in the local repository.

Merge - merging takes changes fetched from the remote repository and applies them to the local repository.

Pull - A combination of the fetch and merge commands. Pulling is the easiest way to update a local repository to be in sync with remote.
